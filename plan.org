* Objectives - Grep for github 
 - Scan github for example that create data structures from scratch (list, hash map, circular list, tree, array) 
   + keywords e.g list, insert, append ?
 - Use GitHub search to find possible examples using keywords, file endings, language restriction 
 - Pull repositories for examples 
 - Utilise regular expressions to find exact examples of data structure of interest being defined (linked list)
 
* Thoughts
 - 1000 results return for each unique query (may return diff results if diff sorting parameter used, indexed or best match )
 - What form do they take ?
   + pull entire project ?
   + run generic makefile to check for the present of thing to transform
	 - what is it that is being transformed or looked for presence of
	 - linked list implementation
 - Pulling each repo to run regex over is going to be slow 
 - limitations of github to 30 requests per minute for The Search API
 - Find file contents via various criteria. This method returns up to 100 results per page.
 - sort Default: best match
 - Simplest approach take the live-grep and feed the web server the repositories returned by the github code search (only uses keywords tho not true grep)
   + build 
 - having a local copy of github is insane so need to be smart use what github offers to reduce downloading repo locally for livegrep to search
 - GitHub Scaper to find interesting repo to clone and then regex (as GitHub Api will only return 1000 res)
 - Incrementaly go through number of stars definitly get diff list of 1000 repos each time :)
 - index files for repos are 5-6x larger than the repos :(
 - does livegrep have someway of paging results endlessly ? (max_matches exists but is that the best way)
 - Clang filtering of reposistories ? reduce the number of required repos to search across
 - Could build DB of every repo on github just having some information on it link to reposistory language information (seems possible)
 - Could build index of code on the fly from filtered list of repositories that are passed to code search tool (Repositories actual code could be stored locally if needed)
 - What are some local tools that are like grep for large set of files ? ([[https://github.com/google/codesearch][google code search tool]], [[https://beyondgrep.com/][ack - grep opt for programmers]], git grep, )
 - way to limit number of results from each repository

* Things I need to know ?
 - What is going to use the result of the tool ? 
   + Rejuvenation tools
   + People interested in examples of code
 - Is this just for transformation examples related to my project ?
 - How limited is the results return by github, can I even get all matches github made.
 - How to get more results return than just 1000
 - How slow can it be ?
 - How interactive does it need to be?
 - what is pulled by livegrep github index tool (whole repo), can you provide non github repos ? (must be able to)
 - can livesearch index not stored in git repo
 - livegrep json list of repos pulled stored in same location as repos
 - what is the security concern of donwloading random repos off the internet
 - do repos have unique ids ?
 - is there a limit on matching time for livegrep query (if so can I increase it or turn it off)
 - Is livegrep faster when query frontend api to get results (does effect match time ?)
 - Is backend quering using the grpc protocol quicker (what do you get back ? (json) )
 - can it regex across lines

* Notes from trying stuff
 - using list as name of file leads to lot of cs student related learning reposistories
 - Backend and frontend deployed on server and but frontend can't communicate with backfront
   + direct calls to backend work using bloomRPC
   + does it work locally with bloomrpc ? (yes) once port is published
 - GITHUB API
   - If results returned by GitHub API are on multiple pages use ?page=3 to specify a page and ?per_page=100 to specify # max number on each page
   - For API requests using Basic Authentication or OAuth, you can make up to *5000* requests per hour.
   - For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows for up to *60* requests per hour. 
 - livegrep has specific file searching in a repo (could be used in conjunction with github api)
   + livegrep returns in code results and name file results
   + api for livegrep accessible https://livegrep.com/api/v1/search/ returns json, web query is https://livegrep.com/search/
   + custom indexing backend, uses Russ Cox's RE2 regex library
   + livegrep can timeout on large number of matches specified "why=TIMEOUT" but time spend is only 12s so could be extended sometime
	 + could be due to livegrep trying to be "live" to instantly return results
	 + there is a flag for setting timeout when starting codesearch
   + Walking HEAD like so  Walking repo_spec name=drx/kiwi, path=repos/drx/kiwi (including  submodules: false) is when index is being built for backend
   + commands like: codesearch_start -grpc localhost:9999  repos/livegrep.json with the repositories already download
	 - builds an in memory index for the backend for repo_pull_test5 which had 1 20.2G index file this is to large to be run
	 - this require an memory mapped index file
   + grep searches the named input FILEs for *lines* containing a match to the given PATTERN.
   + max number of livegrep returns on a simple query was 9100 matches when we had 800 repos in the repository
	 + larger number when we have less repos ? (No message size is limit )
	 + 
   + how to remove repos from search in query "hello repo:(Gateworks/linux-imx6|LeMaker/linux-sunxi)" uses regex actually
	 - kinda odd


* Tasks
 1) Check the extent of github search functionality (write python code to get results and pull porjects)
	- how many keywords allowed to narrow search	

 2) How would pipeline work 1:
	- Users provide some restriction parameters that github can utilise to find repos/files
	- then User provides patterns of what they want to find (like grep) and they are applied to the repositories found earlier.
	  - how are regexs defined to identify linked list candidates?
	  - limited return of github maybe an issue
	  - time taken to download repository would be a problem ? 

 3) How would pipeline work 2:
	- regex provided	
	- then search made to GitHub api where regex is more specific
	- collect results from all searchs to the api and return them to the user

 4) Confirm Number of repositories GitHub Api can return (1000)
	- get more by using star count diff search 

 5) install livegrep on own machine using docker (stress test) (problematic failed to connect frontend to backend)
	- how to get livegrep to index a specific repo not a user
	  + docker run -v $(pwd):/data livegrep/indexer /livegrep/bin/livegrep-github-reindex -repo livegrep/livegrep -http -dir /data
	- test the backend codesearch running in docker with direct GRPD requests ([[https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc][Bloomrpc]]) to ensure it works
	
 6) install livegrep on server using docker or build natively
	- install using blog post (done) or try livegrep repo docker install (trying local install to see if backend and talk to frontend and its just a docker error)
	- installed nativately and worked, built using bazel 0.26 slightly different from the one stated in projects github
	- Check different ways of build index of code or to run without building an index using native tool 
	- find way of passing repository from a list (or github api) to create an index for codesearch backend
	  + get top 1000 repo results for c language then  build index with the set of repos
	  + build a *JSON* file that specifies the required repos (THIS) (what are the formats for local repos, external repo on github (is this possible))
	  + use inbuilt github indexer and feed it a list a repos individually with flag -repo
	  + which is faster the github helper tool are starting codesearch directly with a index.json file ? (advantages/disadvantages)
	  + can livesearch index code not stored in git repo ?
	- Can you limit number of matches per user/repo/file so that the information is not
	- Can you perform multiline grep in livegrep
	  + underlying RE2 regex engine
		1. \n 	newline (≡ \012)
		2. $ at end of text (like \z not \Z) or line (m=true)
		3. ^ at beginning of text or line  
		4. \Z  at end of text, or before newline at end of text (NOT SUPPORTED)
	  + [[https://github.com/livegrep/livegrep/issues/27][Issue]]: "The livegrep index relies pretty heavily on the fact that searches only operate on single lines to enable usage of the index; 
        It'd be difficult to generalize it to multiline searches without some pretty deep changes, so it's not supported right now."
	- Livegrep does have a custom backend [[https://blog.nelhage.com/2015/02/regular-expression-search-with-suffix-arrays/][indexer]] does not use google codesearch this could be the reason for no multi line 

 7) How large is GitHub (tb or pb) 
	- [[https://github.com/search?q=is:public][29 Million public repos]], max size [[https://help.github.com/en/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota][100GB]] so size <2800tb, (need better estimate obviously)
	- 400,000 GitHub repositories, 1 billion files, 14 terabytes of code - [[https://medium.com/@hoffa/400-000-github-repositories-1-billion-files-14-terabytes-of-code-spaces-or-tabs-7cfe0b5dd7fd][Medium]] 
	- so maybe 1015tb if (29M/400,000)*14tb (still not good)
	- repos that are designated c or c++ number around 1M, c = 470k and c++ = 649K
	- 2.5*14tb= 35tb for c/c++ repos

 8) What API/tool exist for GitLab/sourceForge/bitbucket or other source code hosting sites (codeplex, google code)
	- GitLab: has search capabilities and a Restful API
	  + [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/advanced_global_search.html][Advanced Global Search]] (powered by Elasticsearch) is not yet available on GitLab.com
	  + over 1000 repos returned for simple search of ruby pages can keep being request by the looks of it (unlike github)
	- [[https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-the-bitbucket-cloud-rest-apis-222724129.html][BitBucket]]: Restful api & code search ?
	  + Wildcard searches (e.g. qu?ck buil*) are not supported.
	  + Regular expressions in queries are not supported, but you can search for special characters.
	- SourceForge: multiple APIs 	  
	  + Allura API - A read/write API for reading/writing to project info, tickets, wiki pages, etc
	  + Download Stats API - A read-only API for obtaining download statistics
	  + File Release API - set the default download for your project.

 9) How well does GitHub Identify repo language types (pretty well)

 10) Test regex for iterator and see results on large collection (done)
	 - Is the tool actually useful (some wa)

 11) stress test 1000 repos

 12) Can implment multiline grep hack ?

 13) Find way to get more than 9100 result if possible ?
	 - Error/limit
	   + limit for 800 repos seems to be as above (for simple requests like hello that return a lot)
	   + tried with "hello" for 100 repos but only got 4500 matches so can't try limit
	   + search term "he" in 100 repos limit was 8000 (lower than the search for "hello" in 800 repos limit 9100) (very odd)
		 - error message that gets returned { "error": "8 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: Received message larger than max (5296486 vs. 4194304)"}
		 - due to being 2 letter word ? ()
	   + Search term "init" in 100 repos: limit 11600 error: { "error": "8 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: Received message larger than max (4197748 vs. 4194304)"}
	   + 
	 - Solutions
	   - pagnation of some sort ask for first 9000 (or what ever limit is then next amount not including already requested)
	   - can limit then change what repos are being searched to produce distinct result below limit build up response
		 + kind of a hack tho not real fix
	   - 

 14) generic make files test on results from a search
	 - Start by end of day 


* Additional
  - check real-world implementations of linked lists how different people define them.


* TOD0
  1) 1000 repo test on server
  2) Limit problem on results 8000 - 11600 seems to vary a bit something to do with message size being larger than max
  3) Add multiline grep functionality
	 - Get context around first line hit in multigrep specfic number of lines of rest of grep to check
	 - RE2 in python to check
	 - Need way to directly access server from python quickly grpc python lib
	 - Line offset in to file
	 - Will it be quick enough 
  4) Generic makefile to build projects that are from
